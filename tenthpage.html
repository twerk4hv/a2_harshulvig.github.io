        <p>You see a child trapped inside the room. He tells you about the man who kidnapped him. The man sounds similar to the masked man. You rescue the child and search for anything valuable but you find nothing. The child gives you a city route map. You find a symbol of dragon on a huge gate. You remember the place that masked man asked for. That’s it. Dragon’s Way is the exit of this dangerous maze.
